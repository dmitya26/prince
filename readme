Prince

your task as the Prince of Titan is to command 3 of the best armies to defend Titan, the Capital of the universe,
the current residence of Queen Malika, and the last line of defense before the fall of the universe to the hands
of the devil incarnate.

All stops have been pulled, guerrilla warfare ensues... your generals pull ancient magic from arcane scriptures
that are said to have been written by the gods themselves. The Royal Guard, a mysterious class of soldiers who
were so secretive that you'd be lucky if you saw one in your entire life are mobilized into millions of legions
of millions of soldiers, it is a sight to behold. Even you, the Prince of Titan, did not know there were this
many guards, or even that many horses that the guards mount.

It really is a team effort, and your armies are the an amalgamation of talent pulled from all corners of the universe.
This very may well be the most technical battle in the history of the universe, and students and scholars will be studying
it for generations to come.

Prince is a turn-based tower defense grand strategy developed to fulfill my vision of the perfect game.
Very long, drawn out, arduous, and technically complex battles.

The philosophy of this game is to give the minimal amount of detail in order for your imagination to do most of the work. For eample, the graphics are text characters. This is so you can imagine the troops moving. Battle interactions are only shown by one character overtaking another character, but there is in fact a complex process that is behind the battles. You as the player should know that behind all of the highly simplified graphics, there is in fact a lot going on, and it should make you imagine.
